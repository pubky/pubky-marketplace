# Store connections (WooCommerce, Shopify)

Where a seller connects a WooCommerce or Shopify store, chooses which store
products to also publish on Pubky, and sees whether Pubky orders reached the
store. The service side is the connector worker in `pubky-marketplace-service`
(`/v1/connectors`); this page is the Shop side.

## Pages

- `/marketplace/settings/store-connections` lists the connections (Connected,
  Needs attention with the reason, Disconnected), Replace credentials and
  Disconnect, then the connect flows. It is also the page the service sends the
  seller back to after an install (`CONNECTOR_RETURN_URL`).
- `/marketplace/settings/store-connections/[connectionId]` is the catalog: the
  store's products, search, and an "Also publish on Pubky" checkbox per product.
- Orders shows "Orders in your store" for a seller with a connected store: each
  sale's push state, the orders that were not sent with the reason and Retry,
  and store alerts (a store-side cancel asks the seller to cancel and refund in
  Pubky; nothing is refunded automatically).

## Layers

`MarketplaceConnectorsService` (service client) → `ConnectorsApplication` →
`ConnectorsController` → hooks (`useStoreConnections`, `useConnectWooCommerce`,
`useConnectShopify`, `useReplaceStoreCredentials`, `useConnectionStatusCheck`,
`useConnectorCatalog`, `useConnectorPushStatus`) → organisms. Wire shapes,
copy and the pure helpers are in `src/libs/commerce/connectors.ts`.

## Credentials

A Shopify Client ID and secret and a WooCommerce key and secret are typed into
password fields, sent once over TLS to `PUT /v1/connectors/{id}/credentials`, and
cleared from the form as soon as the call returns. They are not kept in React
state beyond the form, Dexie, localStorage, sessionStorage or a store, and no
request body is put in an error context or a log line. The service never returns
them.

## WooCommerce

The seller enters the store address. `POST /v1/connectors` returns the store's
`/wc-auth/v1/authorize` URL, which must be on the same host the seller typed
(anything else is refused). The seller approves on their own store and comes back
with `success=1` (or `0`); the page then runs the status check, which looks a few
times because WooCommerce posts the keys to the service from its own server. The
fallback is a pasted REST key pair (`ck_`/`cs_`), for stores that block the
approval screen.

## Shopify

Until the public app is approved, each merchant creates their own Dev Dashboard
app. The guide creates a draft connection (`POST /v1/connectors`), shows its
per-connection URLs and the exact scopes with copy buttons, takes the Client ID
and secret, sends the merchant to install, and runs the status check (store
name, permissions granted, locations, a test catalog read). A missing scope shows
as Needs attention with the scope names. Steps have a picture slot each: drawn
illustrations now, screenshots as soon as `config/shopify-guide.ts` has entries.

## Fields the service has not documented yet (built against C7)

These are optional in the Shop's schemas, so a service that omits them still
works:

- `status: "draft"` on a Shopify draft connection (besides `pending`).
- `urls: { app_url, allowed_redirection_url, webhook_url }` on the connect
  response or the connection. Without it the Shop shows the fixed C7 paths
  (`/v1/connectors/shopify/c/{id}/launch`, `/oauth/callback`, `/webhooks`) on its
  service origin.
- `credentials_set`, `shop_name` and `location_count` on a connection.
- `PUT /v1/connectors/{id}/credentials` with `{client_id, client_secret}`
  (Shopify) or `{consumer_key, consumer_secret}` (WooCommerce, also used for the
  pasted-key fallback), answering 200 or 204, optionally with `authorize_url`
  (the install link). Without a link the guide tells the merchant to install from
  the Dev Dashboard Home.
- A store that uninstalled the app reads as Disconnected when
  `last_error.message` is `app_uninstalled`, `store_uninstalled` or
  `disconnected`.
